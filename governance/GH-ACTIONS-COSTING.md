GitHub Actions Costing – How to Estimate

Notes
- Costs/minutes vary by plan, OS runner, and repository visibility.
- Check your account billing for exact rates and included minutes.

Estimation Steps
1) Define frequency and duration: e.g., monthly reminder job ~1–2 minutes on `ubuntu-latest`.
2) Use your plan’s per-minute rate for the chosen runner OS.
3) Multiply: minutes × runs per month × rate.
4) Monitor actual usage in GitHub’s Actions billing dashboard and adjust.

Savings Tips
- Use Linux runners where possible.
- Keep jobs short; avoid long build/test in reminder workflows.
- Trigger reminder only monthly and use local scripts for heavy work.
